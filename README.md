## Overview of Project

### Purpose of Analysis

As requested by Steve the purpose of this analysis is to identify in a group 12 stocks of green energy market possible positive investments decisions, analyzing the years of 2017 and 2018. As Steve wants to expand this research through a large amount of data, on this project we will use VBA tolls of programming in order to apply later in a larger scale of stocks.

## Results

### Analysis of Green Stocks between 2017 and 2018

As a result of the data analysis refined by Return and Volume we have the upcoming Table displayed.

The DQ stock, in 2017 almost reach the amount of 200% return, indicating that at this period was a great investment but when compared to 2018 we came across a negative return amount of 63%. That considerable amount indicates that DQ stocks are a big risk investment, and it is recommended that when investing in this market Steve and his family disperse the amount invested on more stable stocks such as ENPH or RUN.

## Coding and Refacturing

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code

One of the main advantages of refactoring codes is to make more efficient way to displayed data and reduce the execution time. When applied to a large data a refactor code can provide precise information in record times that cannot be produce through formulas on Excel.

On the opposite way we must look at the disadvantages of refactoring codes when dealing with such specific and planned codes, if one code is misplaced or spelled incorrectly you can damage a long Code work perfectly done at first. As on the development of this project we learned that copy the original code and always save as backup is essential to move further on refactoring codes.
